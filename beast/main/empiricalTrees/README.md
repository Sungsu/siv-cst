### Constructing phylogenies for each portion of the lentiviral genome  
To assess cross-species transmission, we first built a posterior distribution of ~2000 trees for each segment of the genome [(as identified by GARD)](../../../recombination/). Each tip was labeled with the known host state; host state at internal nodes was inferred.  
### To reproduce  
XMl files can be regenerated by running  
`python path/to/siv-cst/scripts/beastSetup/empiricalTrees_makexml.py path/to/siv-cst/scripts/beastSetup/xmlTemplates/empiricalTrees_template.xml`  
(just adjust chain length and sampling frequency in the template per Methods for each dataset) from within the  
`path/to/siv-cst/data/main/segments` directory.  
Run with BEAST v. 2.4.0 and dynamic BEAGLE scaling.  
  
### Results  
Trees represent the maximum clade credibility trees for each segment after the [discrete trait analysis](../discreteTraits/), color coded by host state. Notably, the topologies vary widely between trees, emphasizing the extent of recombination and the variable selective pressures experienced by each region.
